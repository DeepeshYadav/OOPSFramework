Ad hoc testing is a commonly used term for software testing performed without 
planning and documentation, but can be applied to early scientific experimental s
tudies. The tests are intended to be run only once, unless a defect is discovered.
Ad hoc


During functional testing of software, testers verify the app features against the user specifications. 
This is completely different from testing done by developers which is unit testing. It checks 
whether the code works as expected. Because unit testing focuses on the inner structure of 
the code, it's called the white box testing. On the opposite hand, functional testing checks appâ€™s 
functionalities without observing the inner structure of the code, hence it's called black box 
testing. Despite how flawless the different individual code components could also be , it 
is essential to see that the app is functioning properly, when all components are combined.
